A super-lightweight, universal, "meta" package manager for UNIX-like platforms

## Major commands

1. `search` for packages matching a specified term across all available known package sources
2. `list` all available packages through known package sources
3. `install` packages through available known package sources
4. `uninstall` packages
5. `update` all (or specified) packages through the appropriate available package sources

## How to install

## Dependencies

*Crater* has been written entirely as a shell script, and that helps keep it as lightweight as possible with almost no external dependency except [curl](https://curl.se) and also makes it available on almost all UNIX-like platforms.

You'll need to install *Curl* before using *Crater*.

More documentation coming soon...
